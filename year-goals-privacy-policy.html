  <p>
    This privacy policy applies to the Year Goals app (hereby referred to as the
    "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Bahrican Yeşil
    (hereby referred to as the "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This
    service is intended for use "AS IS".
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

  <p>
    The Application collects information when you download and use it. This
    information may include, but is not limited to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
    <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages</li>
    <li>The time spent using the Application</li>
    <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your
    mobile device (such as GPS-level data).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Application may collect information about the approximate location of your
    device. This helps the Service Provider determine your general geographical
    area and may be used in the ways described below:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Geolocation Services:</strong> The Service Provider utilizes approximate
      location data to provide features such as personalized content, relevant
      recommendations, and location-based services.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized location data
      helps the Service Provider analyze user behavior, identify trends, and
      improve the overall performance and functionality of the Application.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Periodically, the Service Provider may
      transmit anonymized location data to external services. These services
      assist them in enhancing the Application and optimizing their offerings.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact you from
    time to time to provide you with important information, required notices, and
    marketing promotions.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a better experience while using the Application, the Service Provider may
    require you to provide certain personally identifiable information, including
    but not limited to user ID and email address. The information that the Service
    Provider requests will be retained and used as described in this privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Third Party Access</h2>

  <p>
    Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external
    services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their
    service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in
