  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This privacy policy applies to the Eloquence app (the "Application") created by
    Bahrican Yeşil (the "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. The Application is
    provided "AS IS".
  </p>

  <p>
    Eloquence is an AI-powered ritualized learning companion designed to help advanced foreign language learners achieve
    native
    mastery through Socratic dialogue and emotional reflection.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

  <p>
    The Application collects information to provide its core functionality, which involves real-time AI interaction and
    progress tracking. This includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voice and Audio Data:</strong> During "The Reflection" and "The Symposium" sessions, the Application
      captures audio for processing by AI models to facilitate real-time voice-to-voice interaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Transcript Data:</strong> AI-generated transcripts of your conversations are used to create blog posts,
      diary entries, and vocabulary corrections.</li>
    <li><strong>Personal Reflections & Mood:</strong> Narratives of your day and self-reported mood scores (1-10) are
      stored to maintain your private diary and track emotional trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Educational Progress:</strong> Data on vocabulary usage (e.g., C1/C2 level words), session
      participation, and goals are collected to provide "The Native Bridge" learning metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Onboarding Data:</strong> Your current language level and specific learning goals provided during setup.
    </li>
  </ul>
