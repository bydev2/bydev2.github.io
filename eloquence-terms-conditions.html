  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Eloquence</strong>. By accessing or using our mobile application, you agree to be bound by these
    terms and conditions (the "Terms"). If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Application.</p>

  <h2>1. The Service</h2>
  <p>
    Eloquence provides a dual-purpose AI companion for advanced language learners. Through "The Symposium" and "The
    Reflection" rituals, users engage with AI personas (Socratic Coach and Empathetic Therapist) powered by AI. The goal
    is to provide linguistic refactoring and intellectual/emotional growth.
  </p>

  <h2>2. AI Disclaimer (Important)</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Eloquence is an AI-powered educational tool.</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Socratic Coaching:</strong> The "Socratic Coach" helps with logical exercise and language mastery; it is
      not a substitute for formal education or professional consulting.</li>
    <li><strong>Empathetic Therapist Persona:</strong> While the "Reflection" session uses an empathetic persona,
      <strong>Eloquence is NOT a medical or mental health service.</strong> The AI is not a licensed therapist. If you
      are experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact professional emergency services immediately.
    </li>
    <li><strong>AI Accuracy:</strong> While we use AI, AI can "hallucinate" or provide incorrect
      information. Use the output at your own discretion.</li>
